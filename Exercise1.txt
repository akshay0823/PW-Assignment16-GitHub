1.Explain what is version control is and its importance in software development?

 Ans: Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to track and manage modifications made to a project's code or documents. It maintains a history of changes, facilitates collaboration among team members, and helps manage different versions of the project.

 Here are some key aspects and importance of version control in software development:

 History Tracking: Version control systems (like Git, SVN, Mercurial) maintain a timeline of changes made to files. This allows developers to review past versions, understand the evolution of the project, and identify when and by whom specific modifications were made.

 Collaboration: It enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Branching and merging functionalities in version control systems facilitate parallel development and integration of changes.

 Error Identification and Rollback: If an error is introduced into the code, version control allows for quick identification of when the issue was introduced and by whom. This makes it easier to revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and potential loss of work.

 Backup and Recovery: Version control systems serve as a backup mechanism for project files. In case of accidental deletion or loss of data, the history of the project can be used to restore previous versions.

 Code Reviews and Collaboration: Version control systems support code reviews and collaboration by providing mechanisms for commenting on specific changes, suggesting improvements, and maintaining a clear overview of discussions related to code modifications.

 Branching and Experimentation: Developers can create branches to experiment with new features or changes without affecting the main codebase. This enables isolated development, where new ideas can be tested without disrupting the stable version.

 Overall, version control is crucial in software development because it enhances collaboration, tracks changes effectively, helps in identifying and resolving issues, and ensures the integrity and stability of the codebase throughout the development lifecycle.
